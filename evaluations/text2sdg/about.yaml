  The text2sdg package is an open-source package for the programming language R
  that identifies SDGs in texts. It uses five different query systems: Aurora,
  Elsevier, SIRIS, SDSN, and OSDG. The package provides functions for detecting
  SDGs in text, as well as for analyzing and visualization the hits found in
  text.

  The text2sdg package is developed by Dirk U. Wulff and Dominik S. Meier, with
  contributions from Rui Mata and the Center for Cognitive and Decision
  Sciences. It is published under the GNU General Public License.
