One billion girls and boys ages 2-17 worldwide experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence in the prior year, according to one study.94 Some 25 percent of children suffer physical abuse, and nearly 20 percent of girls are sexually abused at least once in their life.95 Elder abuse remains a hidden problem:96 10 percent of older adults were abused in the prior month.97 Homicide is also a major social concern. Physical security and freedom from the threat of violence were particular concerns among female respondents (box 2.7).

It is only out of such struggles that it has eventually emerged in the shape that we now use as the model of good governance. The destiny of the State has been determined by local stakeholders with an interest in improving governance.","16"

The only exceptions are Slovakia and Hungary, where severe deprivation increased to a greater extent than would have been (linearly) predicted based on their standard deprivation rates, and Ireland and Poland, where the reverse pattern was observed. However, as the child deprivation module is currently only available for one wave, it cannot be used to analyse the changes during the Great Recession.

A sharp decrease in poverty rates can also be expected from a reduction in the child penalty bom by single-parents in many countries (Austria, Belgium, Chili, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Portugal, Sweden, Tukey and the United States) where the lowest poverty rates among single parents occur when the poverty rate for single parents is the same for childless singles (Table 5).

"182044d","Increases in house prices slowed down around the period of the financial crisis, but then price inflation went back to its pre-crisis level. Overall, house prices in household income increased sharply, and after falling around 2008, the house price to rent ratio returned to rising sharply. Recently, house prices declined in energy-producing regions, continued to rise strongly in Vancouver and Toronto, and have risen modestly elsewhere. In this context, the purchase of real estate often becomes unaffordable for low-income families who, as it will be seen in the next section, are increasingly likely to rent their homes. The standardised price-rent and price-income ratios show the current price-rent and price-income ratios relative to their respective long-term averages.","1, 7"
"4d3f00a","However, the stimulus that these policies provide are very small at the macroeconomic level, and are far from fully counteracting the crisis’ negative effects on real GDP growth (figure 13). The policy of cash transfers appears to be the least effective in this sense, although its results are not enormously different from those produced by the VAT reduction policy or elimination of customs tariffs on food products. These results are consistent with expectations at the macroeconomic level, indeed, if the simulated policies can provide a rapid response to the socioeconomic harm of the crisis, their effects are only transitory and, as a consequence, are not sustained enough to address alone concerns about economic recovery. To effectively boost growth, specific policies would have to be implemented to encourage accumulation and efficient use of production factors, along with improved productivity. However, measures which flow from such policies are not generally applied immediately and cannot be seen as rapid responses in cases of exogenous shocks.","8"
"2103449","Indeed, there is no guarantee that results on the capacity of a social programme to reduce poverty by a given amount will translate to another country if the poverty line is set in a different way. We propose that this line be set at a multiple of median income, which makes the poverty line sensitive to the distribution of welfare in the country, rather than being solely determined by the mean of the welfare metric used. This relative poverty line can fruitfully be used alongside an absolute poverty line, which we set at the level of the international dollar-a-day poverty line. Considering that the international 1.25 dollar-a-day poverty line sets a minimum income for fulfilling survival needs, the 1.25 dollar-a-day line may appear more relevant when the relative poverty line falls below this level.","1, 10"

Similarly, this analysis strongly confirms the importance of better market integration and investment in rural infrastructure to help reduce transport and energy costs thereby better transmitting the opportunities created by market opening to those regions. Today, food and other agricultural products are sourced globally as much as manufactured products and the expanding markets for agro-food products are opening up new opportunities for developing countries (see Box 4). Participation in regional or global agro-food value chains allows developing country producers to overcome the limits imposed by their small domestic markets. It provides them access to more vibrant markets, allowing them to upgrade their production processes and improve the quality and value-added of their products.

"2f56281","This argument is supported in the report by a number of case studies that illustrate that, although macro-economic policy reforms have had positive effects on agriculture in some parts of Africa, the overall impact of the reforms has been slower and less dramatic than could have been expected. The main reason for the reforms' restricted impact is that the constraints to achieving sustainable agricultural productivity and increasing yields lie both on and off the farm. Hence, in many cases, transportation, trade, and macroeconomic policies have stronger effects on farmer and trader incentives than do agricultural sector policies, a point that underscores the need for better policy coordination across ministries. Strategies should therefore focus on transforming the weak points along the food system as a whole, and avoid too narrow a focus on farming.","2, 9, 11, 12"

The pursuit of food self-sufficiency to mitigate international risks is a costly policy that undermines the function of the international trading system, making markets thinner, more volatile and therefore riskier than if countries were to adopt open trade policies. In the face of both international and domestic risks, such as that of a failed harvest, a country which uses trade barriers to promote self-sufficiency because of the fear of trade interruptions may find itself exposed to greater potential losses than if it had remained open to international trade. At the national level, some developing countries may be vulnerable to imported instability, notably if their consumption is centred around just one or two food staples, and if their imports are sourced from just one or two countries. These risks can be mitigated by promoting more diversified diets (something that happens naturally to a degree as incomes rise) and by diversifying trading partners.","17"

However, between the 1980s and the end of the century, a slowing or stalling of indigenous health improvements measured by life expectancy meant that the gap failed to close significantly (Canada) or even widened (New Zealand and the United States). In fact, because indigenous peoples are essentially invisible in the data collection of many international agencies and in most national censuses, the disparities in their health situation as compared to other groups continue to be obscured. Similarly, even when indigenous peoples appear in health data, they are often conceived of as a percentage of a national population, which UNICEF has noted ""can be misleading in as much as the distribution of certain indigenous peoples does not correspond to national boundaries.","3"

"9ddfb24","About 90% of health funds’ income for providing NHI services comes from government (Figure 2.9), about half of which comes from an earmarked component of national insurance contributions (often referred to as the “health tax”), the rest from general taxation. Almost all of the government-to-fund transfer is through a capitation payment based on the age and sex profile of each fund’s client base and a “remoteness” variable (which was added in 2010 and is discussed further below). In contrast, transfers between the funds and the providers are based on health services provided (or approximations thereof). Hence, in principle, one of the key strengths of the system is that the health funds have incentives to ensure the efficient provision of services and to engage in preventive measures - a healthy client base means fewer costs through the reimbursement system.","3"

The first PISA assessment in 2000 was able to explain about a third of the performance variation among schools across the participating countries, but in 2015 that figure had risen to 85%. That means that most of the performance differences among schools can now be statistically associated and explained, with data from students, parents, teachers and school principals, even if the causal nature of many of those relationships remains still insufficiently understood.

It includes at the minimum the payment of 100% of tuition fees if the student is above a given cut-off score. But it can also include a monthly stipend (if above a higher cut-off score) and a semester studying abroad (if above an even higher cut-off score). There are indications that, as a result of this initiative, the average PSU score of students entering teacher education has increased in 2011.

"c3a1c8f","Some firms might be more sensitive to some types of barriers than to others. One is commonly known as the rebound effect. An example is the driver who replaces a car with a more fuel-efficient model, only to take advantage of its cheaper running costs to drive further and more often. Rebound effects have long been neglected, but their consequences could be profound.",NA
"c3b2bac","Some energy efficient devices (e.g. variable speed drives) may be more susceptible to voltage or frequency fluctuations on the grid. Energy efficient devices moreover often involve new technology with low operating experience. The highly technical realities underlying such investments result in investors demanding an implicitly higher rate of return to offset the perceived higher risk of energy efficiency projects. Finally, a perception of high transaction costs can emerge because of the small size of EE projects relative to other projects.","7, 9, 12"
"c8c065e","Since 2007 Italy has provided tax relief for energy efficiency improvements to existing buildings including the installation of double-glazed windows, thermal insulation, high-efficiency boilers and the installation of solar panels. In 2009, building owners submitted 240,000 tax credit applications. As the programme was originally expected to be terminated in 2010, the number of applications in 2010 exceeded the previous year by around 71%.","7, 12"
"c913bb6","Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Svalbard have experienced an increase in tourism levels as well, though at a lower level than Iceland, with a growth ranging from 15% to 45% since 2012. As the duration of the visits have not increased, the increased spending is caused by a higher daily spending by the tourists. Tourism may create short and long-term profits and jobs for a region leading to economic growth, provided it is managed sustainably.","8"
"c91436b","Green job growth over the next 5-10 years is expected to be highest in the building and transportation sectors. Higher energy consumption, rising greenhouse gas emissions, road congestion and deteriorating water quality are the negative externalities that have come with urban growth. Many metropolitan regions across the OECD have turned their attention to the concept of green growth as a means of increasing economic competitiveness through addressing environmental challenges (Box 1.1). What do we mean by urban green growth?","6, 7, 11, 12, 13"
"cae61a2","On the production side (industry, commerce and agriculture), significant changes are expected as the economy grows nearly eightfold. This implies a massive expansion of the commercial/services sector (by a factor of six), a significant expansion of manufacturing activity, and more limited growth of activity in agriculture. However, water needs to be pumped from increasing depth and this is the main source of electricity demand in agriculture. Sources: IEA, 2009b, IEA, 2010a, IEA, 2009c.","6, 7, 8"
"cbee969","In addition, in 2014, EUR 5.8 mln from local budgets was used to finance energy efficiency measures (EEA, 2015). To date, there have been three calls. The first, in 2013, was launched for public institutions (including schools and hospitals), resulting in the selection of 86 projects worth a total of MDL 135 mln (about EUR 78 000 per project on average).","7, 8, 9, 12, 16"

Primary education is critical for developing a semi-skilled labour force. In low-income countries with large rural sectors, it can be vital for equipping farmers with the basic skills necessary to their being informed on and implementing sustainable agricultural and forestry practices. However, while the significance of achieving universal primary education is highlighted by its inclusion as a Millennium Development Goal, secondary, vocational and tertiary education are just as important in the field of green technology. Secondary education can provide core skills and knowledge needed for countries’ economic growth. Vocational schooling can be particularly useful in building technological competencies, successful vocational education also provides important links between education and industry.","4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15"
"8cda120","In addition to targets, the scope of instruments related to renewable energy being introduced is also broadening, demonstrating a deepening commitment towards renewable energy. For instance, Sri Lanka, under its latest energy sector development plan, is seeking to significantly increase the share of renewable energy while reducing petroleum imports, which have risen dramatically over the past decades (Sri Lanka, Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, 2015). Pacific Island States, particularly the Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, are leading the region in setting up an ambitious target of 100 per cent renewable energy. Additionally, under the country’s Energy Development Strategic Action Plan, hydro is expected to reach approximately 350 GW.","7"

Building technological capacities can help developing countries “catch up” with more advanced countries, and innovation policy must play an important role in facilitating sustainable development. The present chapter argues that green sustainable development-oriented innovation policies should be an integral part of countries’ national development strategies.","4, 8, 9, 10, 11"
"e4b06ab","If the latter are already difficult to determine for marketed goods, the intrinsic complexity of external costs prevents the establishment of social welfare functions adopting a broader notion of welfare. To a large extent social costs are external, i.e. not internalised, precisely because no well-defined utility functions exist. Discussion quickly shows that any framework based solely on static optimisation will run into internal contradictions.","1, 10"
"e86163a","Prices that are too low or too volatile discourage investment. Volatile prices also discourage consumers, particularly if their demand elasticity is low. It is a challenge to reach optimal investments levels. Liquid markets on the one side and long-term contracts on the other are important factors in providing investors in producer countries with the necessary visibility for investing in adequate capacity for production, storage and transport.","9"
"ecef776","For low-level consumption the higher income group is charged 150 per cent of the price paid by the low-income group. With a sufficiently large consumer base that has enough high-income consumers, the water tariff enables the recovery of costs and the progressive structure supports poor people. The costs are associated with operating, maintaining and extending the water networks and providing basic levels of service.","1, 6, 12"
"ecfb0da","The percentage of the population that has access to electricity ranges from 18 per cent in PNG to 100 per cent in Samoa (Figure 9.4). A larger proportion of hydro power, for example in Fiji, is likely to reduce the electricity tariff, whereas a country that relies mostly on fossil fuels, such as Kiribati or Tuvalu, is more vulnerable to increasing oil prices. Another factor affecting the residential electricity tariff is whether it is subsidised through the Government budget, for example in Fiji, or using a cross subsidy from larger users of electricity, for example in Vanuatu. Each power utility in each country determines its tariffs differently.","7, 11"
"f39b390","A discussion of the rebound effect in energy efficiency is needed that incorporates not just the expected energy savings from energy efficiency but also the wider socioeconomic outcomes. Policy measures are needed to overcome the market and behavioural failures that lead to less investment in energy efficiency than is optimal. It is important to overcome critical challenges that involve complex synergies and trade-offs among the different aspects of energy efficiency policy.","7, 9, 12"

Following the adoption of the programme by the Palau Housing Authority, every new housing loan in Palau is eligible for the grant. The programme was later revised to include existing houses and for loans for solar PV.","6, 7, 11"
"f49268f","This debate is in line with South Africa's rural electrification agenda, as new power generation will be necessary to service more households. The average official unemployment figures are above 20% (see Table 33), excluding the under-employed in the rural and urban areas or those who are not registered in employment agencies. Payment for electricity is an issue for people who have no or very little income. Many cases of domestic violence in newly electrified households have been amply documented. It is argued that domestic trouble starts over priorities when resources are scarce (Habitat for Humanity, 2009). However, the long-term effect of ensuring universal access to electricity should lead to general opportunities for a broad-based economic development.","5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16"
"8049d8c","By 2014, more than 1,000 microhydro systems had been installed, with total generating capacity of 22 MW, providing off-grid electricity access to 20 per cent of the population. Credible long-term policy commitment, with flexible approach to implementation and reduced administrative burdens, is essential to sustaining mini-grid deployment. In this respect, the availability of a potential anchor load — i.e., a consumer of a large and possibly stable proportion of the power generated (for instance a small factory, hospital or farmer cooperative) — supplementing households’ electricity demand is usually critical to support mini-grid profitability and increase capacity utilization.","7, 11, 12"
"fa14de4","Electrification of schools, however, is facing problems largely stemming from lack of information about the number of schools and their electrification status. Some municipalities fail to report the number of schools in their area or fail to provide accurate information on whether the schools are electrified or not. It is clear that this poses a major constraint for the entities in charge of the electrification of the as-yet un-electrified schools.","7"
"fc69b2f","Additionally, renewable energy depends on variable wind, sun and exogenous conditions that are intermittent and more difficult to schedule than conventional fossil fuels. Given the limited and still developing electricity storage technology' at utility scale, it is economical to integrate intermittent renewables into larger, flexible electricity systems. The fossil fuel-based generation can be backed down when renewables are available, and with an electricity grid system that covers large geographical areas, the available average renewable resources would be easier to schedule.","7, 9, 13"

All regression models include education, experience, and period fixed effects, and a full set of two-way interactions. In this context, the educational attainment of foreign- and native-born workers is also taken into account. Thereafter, the chapter looks at factors that help explain why the contribution of foreign-born workers may be different from native-born workers based on qualitative studies of selected sectors.","4"

"948ff61","These, however, also constitute opportunities for those responsible for tourism and water policy to work closely together. In the future, tourism-related water use intensities are expected to increase, while water availability in many regions will become more restricted due to competing uses and climate change leading to lower precipitation levels in many regions. In order to adapt to inevitable changes in water availability, as well as to mitigate its own contribution to climate change and its pressure on limited water resources, tourism needs to engage with policy areas responsible for energy- and water management, with a clear focus on policy making, including compliance with national greenhouse gas reduction goals, building codes, measurement and charging of water consumption, compliance with water benchmarks, and, possibly, mandatory education for staff in accommodation to engage in water saving measures.","4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16"

It could be argued that life expectancy variables show little variation among OECD countries and over time (and thus do not help discriminating between policy effects). However, weak variability among countries does not seem to be borne out by the data, even if only OECD countries are considered11.","3, 10"

"8cd7f8b","Finally, employers in some countries appear to be showing a greater propensity to hoard labour than in past recessions.78 By reducing the increase in unemployment, greater reliance on hours adjustment may tend to reduce the build-up of the number of long-term unemployed during the recession and the number of workers withdrawing from the labour force (or postponing labour market entry) due to poor job-search prospects, indirectly reducing hysteresis effects. However, that need not be the case. Labour market segmentation could be further heightened by increased labour hoarding, if the resulting reduction in labour turnover rates places unemployed job seekers at a heightened risk of long-term unemployment, even though there are fewer of them.","8"

Labour market segmentation and economic decision-making norms restrict the range of possible jobs in which women can participate.

In practice, integration between tourism and emergency management policies has been very limited and quite narrow in focus in most countries.

Consequently, unskilled own-account workers, unpaid family workers or apprentices, owners and employees of micro-enterprises and domestic workers are all considered informal. This is related to the introduction of the concept of decent work. In order to focus the discussion on the job rather than the company, the new conceptual framework of the “informal economy"" has been proposed in order to complement that of the informal sector, given that informal activities are found in both low- and high-productivity sectors.","1, 8, 9, 10"

"520cbe5","The unbalanced growth model is based around exploiting scale economies and complementarities in favoured sectors that can induce more investment and productivity growth. Those sectors, in Hirschman’s framework, have more backward and forward linkages, the former referring to provision of inputs from other activities and sectors, the latter to demand for new activities. The development policy challenge is, accordingly, about identifying lead sectors, addressing missing linkages and strengthening inter-industry and intersectoral interdependencies to boost productivity growth. In this sequence, infrastructure would follow rather than lead the growth process. It is largely around this sequencing issue that differences between balanced and unbalanced growth strategies emerged in early development policy debates (see box 4.2).

By comparing the mechanical income effects of redistribution systems between different periods, it is possible to identify family and earnings situations that are better or worse off as a result of policy reforms. For simplicity, we refer to these families, respectively, as “gainers” and “losers”. Results are shown for the same 8 OECD countries that were included in the above summary of policy changes.

In general, changes on the benefit side can therefore be expected to be a more significant driver of the extent of overall redistribution and inequality. On average across 29 OECD countries, cash support for working-age individuals and their families has grown in real terms but has accounted for a declining share of total social spending (the share fell from 27% in 1985 to 25% in 1995 and 21% in 2005).","1, 8, 10"

Outcomes from economic incentives alone, however, may not be sufficient to generate environmentally or socially meaningful results, because actors generally stop making improvements once the economic incentive to do so ends, whether or not sufficient social or environmental progress has been made. Examples of economic mechanisms employed by OECD governments include also disincentives such as increased fees on waste disposal, and incentives such as government procurement policies and a potential reduction in the value added tax (VAT) and tax for environmentally friendly products (all promoted by the government of the Czech Republic, among others).","11, 12"

In expanding its green purchasing policy, the government should make sure that it targets goods and services with the highest potential environmental returns. This outcome was achieved with minor increases in public expenditure. Since the introduction of the green public procurement policy, the market shares of eco-friendly products widely used in the public administration have substantially increased (Figure 9). According to MOE’s estimates, the national government’s green purchasing policy resulted in a reduction of C02 emissions by 89 500 tonnes in 2006, which is equivalent to the amount of C02 emitted by a town of 42 000 inhabitants.

"cb355f9","In coastal areas, the challenge often exists of preventing the destruction of sand dunes owing to the construction of tourism facilities close to the water. The degradation of sand dunes not only alters the coastal ecosystem but, in the long run, also increases those facilities’ exposure to storms and water rise (Magnan, 2014). This situation entails a typical tradeoff between economic development and environmental challenges. Ideally, an integrated approach would attenuate the impact of the trade-off by limiting habitat degradation and consequently the collateral effect on assets in terms of their exposure to climate-related hazards. Such an approach may not completely eliminate the trade-off, but, by taking into account the negative effects, it can put in place compensation mechanisms, such as for protecting marine ecosystems so as to allow them to maintain their natural resilience and adaptive capacities, and then ensuring that their buffering function against waves is maintained (ibid.).","6, 8, 13, 14, 15"

The private sector is not monolithic, hence development co-operation approaches to private sector engagement need to be tailored to specific private sector beneficiaries (e.g. multinational companies, utilities, local SMEs, commercial banks) and contexts, taking into account potential multipliers which can contribute in disseminating information, approaches and state of the art concepts (e.g. business associations, chambers, business developers, industrial zone management).

"0471e4b","The average FTEs per unit remained unchanged from 2010 at 37. While the main reason for the contraction seen in the number of sea fish processing units and FTE jobs was ceased operations, other common reasons include reorientation towards processing salmon (as salmon processing is not included in seafood processing data) and processing no longer being the main income generating activity of the business. Smaller units (1-10 FTE band) account for only 6% of industry employment, whilst representing 45% of total processing units.

"f199f58","Most of the expansion is projected in the RoW group, in particular Sub-Saharan Africa. After peaking (before 2030), global food crop area is projected to decline, particularly in North America, Brazil, Russia, South Asia and China. This is based on the assumptions of slowly growing populations in the OECD and a shrinking population in Russia and China, stabilising diets (i.e. maximum caloric intake being reached) in most OECD and BRIICS countries, and increasing crop yields due to technological improvements (for a further discussion of the agricultural land projections under the Baseline scenario, see Chapter 2).","2, 11, 15"

The chapter provides an overview of the different policy instruments available for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, ranging from regulations to market-driven approaches, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES). Some more ambitious policy scenarios are examined - such as the implications of meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Target under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to expand the global protected area network to at least 17% of terrestrial land by 2020.","14, 15"
"170d7d6","Overall, the relative impact of land-use change and management on MSA loss is projected to decrease. While expansion of food crop production and live-stock farming is projected to cause about half of the further MSA loss in the RoW between 2010 and 2030, it is not projected to be a major driver of further loss in the OECD countries or the BRIICS. Instead of agricultural land expansion, land abandonment is projected to occur in several regions, allowing considerable area for ecosystem recovery and regeneration to take place. These areas will however bear the effects of “former land use” for several decades after land abandonment.

"8b069a6","Second, the entity in charge of examining appeals must be independent of the micro-institution that is responsible for making or implementing decisions. Three possible mechanisms of appeal are commonly used: mediation, based on the common agreement to look for an acceptable settlement (e.g. through a conciliation commission), arbitration, which transfers decisions to independent parties, and courts. Costs tend to be higher for courts than for arbitration, and higher for arbitration than mediation. Other characteristics of institutions that are generally desirable are the capacity to coordinate and delegate, clear assignment of rights and responsibilities, involvement of stakeholders, methods of appeal, and capacity to promote good norms of behaviour (Table 2.2).","16"

Different organisational forms exist with or without legal identity, but a key point is that IDRIS should have clear added value. The OECD reports provide relevant information for IDRIS, summarising issues on road mapping and single-sited large international research infrastructures that may also be applicable to IDRIS. Often, only parts of these entities (as opposed to entire entities) collectively constitute the infrastructure. The agreement need not necessarily define a new legal entity, or be legally binding.","6, 9, 16"

"78995e0","For example, in recent years the European Union has adopted two instruments, the 2002 EU Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management and the 2008 Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which offer a comprehensive and integrated approach to the management of all European coasts and marine waters, and set medium- and long-term objectives (to 2020 and beyond) for member states for managing their ocean activities. East Asia has its Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA), an international organisation focused on coastal and ocean governance in east Asia, scaling up integrated coastal management initiatives and aiming to improve technical co-operation in ecosystem-based management of watersheds, estuaries and adjacent coastal seas. In addition to the lack of protection that such gaps afford the ocean environment and its biodiversity, they create a decision-making vacuum for many ocean industries, notably in respect of future investment. By way of illustration, the negotiations around the implementation of the UN agreement to protect marine biodiversity promise to usher in a period of considerable uncertainty for those ocean industries operating in the high seas.","14"

One of the main drivers for doing so was the realisation in the 1970s and 1980s of the extent of the traffic in toxic wastes to Africa and other developing regions12. The Basel Convention is of relevance, as much of the waste trade involves plastics, and some of these contain relatively high levels of additive chemicals which are in Annex I or II of the Convention. These have known toxicological effects, with serious human health implications.","3, 6, 9, 12"

In this regard they further committed to urgently take the measures necessary to maintain or restore all stocks at least to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield, with the aim of achieving these goals in the shortest time feasible, as determined by their biological characteristics.

Iceland’s National Strategy for Sustainable Development contains objectives specific to living marine resources and state that management should both aim to minimise any negative ecosystem impacts associated with fishing and use the best scientific information available to ensure fish stocks remain at sustainable levels. The management system has proven successful at achieving most of this, securing an economically sustainable fishing industry while also contributing to biological sustainability'. The Icelandic fleet has been reducing in size and becoming more profitable, the carbon footprint of the industry is reducing, fishing pressure has been declining and safety at sea has radically improved in recent decades.","7, 12, 13, 14"
"8d4c4cc","From the forest sector, data from Honduras show that it was 75% cheaper to produce and transport illegal wood than legal wood (Wells et al, 2007). One study estimated that illegal timber depresses global prices of timber by between 7% and 16%, costing US exporters at least USD 460 million a year (Seneca Creek Associates and Wood Resources International, 2004). Illegal harvesters are also able to free-ride on the efforts of those who are striving to manage a resource sustainably, for example, those fishing illegally from managed fisheries or in conservation areas, so increasing the costs for legitimate operators. Examples would be damage to equipment because of the use of poor-quality ODS counterfeit products, or the costs of remediation after the illegal dumping of waste.","12, 14, 15"

"a61daf5","In England, the “Enclosures” deprived many poor peasants of access to land their families had used for centuries. The conflicts and misery generated were even worse than those that will inevitably accompany any solution for fisheries. For example, in one incident in 1607, known as the Newton Rebellion, a battle between the gentry and peasantry left around 50 people dead, and the peasant ringleaders were hanged and quartered. Access to some resources is controlled, notably in EEZ, and there are attempts to extend control to the whole “territory”.","14"
"dd67e2a","Further, EU employment law requires that EU DWF crew receive two months of paid holiday—including transfers— for each four months of work onboard .8 EU DWF crew also receive several days of holiday when the fish is offloaded, whereas crew on Filipino and Taiwanese boats often do the stevedoring themselves (ibid.). This heterogeneity in part contributes to the complexity of analysing the potential implications of proposed fisheries subsidies disciplines at the WTO. First, it is difficult to identify and prove a 'trade distortion' for fish products since the same species normally fetch widely different prices because of complex quality and market differentials. Second, the WTO's analytical emphasis on exchange/ trade means subsidies are defined mainly in terms of export distortions, which the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) suggests should be assessed by examining negative trade effects such as market share or prices in an export market.","8, 14"
"8442213","Further disciplines could also be considered for capacity-enhancing subsidies. Besides subsidies for IUU fishing and overfishing and overcapacity, developing countries, including LDCs and small vulnerable economies (SVEs), should be permitted to provide fisheries subsidies for coastal and commercial fishing activities. These proposals reflect the position held by SVEs since the late 2000s—that disciplines should fall hardest on developed WTO members with large-scale distant water fishing (DWF) fleets, allowing developing countries and LDCs the policy space to provide subsidies to support the sustainable development of their domestic fisheries. The main new addition of the ACP and LDC proposals was to draw attention to subsidies that support fishing in the high seas. General disciplines for the elimination of subsidies contributing to IUU fishing and prohibition of certain forms of fisheries subsidies contributing to overfishing and overcapacity would enter into force no later than 2020.","6, 10, 14"
