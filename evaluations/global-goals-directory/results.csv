These systems have an essential role to play in addressing persistent poverty, protecting households against income and health-related risks and tackling income inequality. It revealed that having social protection systems in place before a crisis strengthens the effectiveness of social policy responses to changing needs. The first is to ensure that social protection systems provide adequate support to those who need it in a context of limited fiscal resources and weak administration and a high rate of informal work that leaves large parts of the workforce uncovered by the main instruments of social policy.",10,True,"[1, 10]",True,True

Important regional efforts and experiences in this regard include the creation of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, in which Mexico and seven Central American countries participate, the expansion of the Serranfa del Chiribiquete natural park in Colombia and that country's policy of conservation in the Amazon region, as well as the tropical rainforest conservation programme in Brazil, which has spurred a strong expansion in protected areas in the region and has become the driving force in reducing deforestation in the Amazon region. One example was the domestication of plants of tremendous economic value that were grown in species-rich areas inhabited by sophisticated ancient civilizations. This process was key in the development of agriculture and gave rise to hubs of origin of major crops such as maize, yucca, potatoes, peanuts, beans, squash, tomatoes, cacao, quinoa and others.",10,False,"[2, 15]",False,True
