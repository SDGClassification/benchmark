name: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
about: |
  GPT-4 is the latest iteration of OpenAI's language model. It can solve
  difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general
  knowledge and problem solving abilities. With 128k context, fresher knowledge
  and the broadest set of capabilities, GPT-4 Turbo is considered more powerful
  than GPT-4 and offered at a lower price.

  The SDG classification was conducted by relying on GPT's inherent knowledge of
  the Sustainable Development Goals. No information about the SDGs was passed
  into the prompt, as you can see below.

  Note that the results can vary significantly depending on the prompt and
  parameters (such as temperature) used. If you find a configuration that yields
  better results, please let us know.

  System Prompt:

  ```
  You are an intelligent multi-label classification system designed to map texts to their relevant Sustainable Development Goals.

  Take the text delimited by triple quotation marks and return a JSON list of relevant SDGs. Example: {"sdgs": [1, 6, 14]}
  ```

  Prompt:

  ```

  Text: """{text}"""
  ```
