1afd2ee,"Trade liberalisation (the removal of barriers to cross-border trade) has historically been negotiated at the World Trade Organization (WTO), trade agreements negotiated there translate into impacts within countries and therefore have significant implications for household wellbeing and gender equality1.

Yet, there have been only limited attempts over the decades during which global trade negotiations have been taking place to mainstream2, or integrate, gender concerns into trade policy and negotiations.

One example was the domestication of plants of tremendous economic value that were grown in species-rich areas inhabited by sophisticated ancient civilizations. This process was key in the development of agriculture and gave rise to hubs of origin of major crops such as maize, yucca, potatoes, peanuts, beans, squash, tomatoes, cacao, quinoa and others.",10,False,"[13, 15]",False,True
