about: |
  OSDG (v1) is an open-source tool that assigns labels to scientific content
  based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It uses an ontology of 10k+
  keywords for detecting SDGs in text.

  A paper about the tool is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14569

  A newer version of the OSDG tool (v2) uses machine learning and can yield
  better results. It is not available open source, but it can be accessed
  online at https://osdg.ai/

  OSDG is a partnership between PPMI, UNDP SDG AI Lab, and a growing community
  of researchers led by Dr. Nuria Bautista Puig.
