name: AFD SDG Prospector
about: |
  The SDG Prospector uses deep learning techniques to analyze the information
  contained in any written document. The SDG Prospector builds upon
  DistilRoBERTa, a light version of a model first developed by Meta. The
  accuracy of the SDG Prospector derives directly from the quality of the
  learning base. Exclusively built by selecting relevant texts manually, the
  learning base consists of over 9,000 paragraphs related to the SDGs. For each
  SDG, more than 500 paragraphs were collected, of maximum 200 words. These were
  mostly extracted from specialized UN official documents and completed with
  texts from other sources.

  The SDG Prospector is the result of a research project initiated in 2021 by
  the Agence Française de Développement (AFD).
