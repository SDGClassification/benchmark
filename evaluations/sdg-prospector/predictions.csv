For instance, the Gini coefficients for urban local workers and migrant workers are 0.424 and 0.310, respectively. Second, when including migrants with urban residents, inequality in urban areas decreases: the Gini falls from 0.424 to 0.405, and more significantly, GE (-1) falls from 0.523 to 0.461.’",[10]

There should exist an office (‘Defender of the Right to Trade’), potentially located within UNCTAD, that would have the right to bring suit against any country seen as violating the right to trade as defined above. They have recognised that opening up their markets to these countries would have little impact on their own economies (indeed, to the extent that trade restrictions are distortionary, benefiting producers at the expense of consumers, overall welfare would probably increase), but could be of enormous benefit to the least-developed countries.",[]
a252d92,"The PIAAC survey provides a measure of the numeracy and literacy skills. One obvious concern in the context of the present analysis is to what extent these measures actually reflect skills acquired while in education, given that skills are likely to depreciate with age, and might be complemented by those accumulated at work. These concerns are addressed both empirically and based on previous results suggesting that PIAAC skills largely reflect those accumulated while studying (see Annex 3 for a discussion).",[4]
79a14a9,"Income Inequality has declined in many of the countries that experienced sustained economic growth, while increasing in countries with negative growth. In most countries whose per capita income/consumption grew during this period, growth was faster for the bottom 40 per cent of the population. Others have a more complex decision-making mechanism in place.","[8, 10]"

This indicator is a proxy for the behaviour of the gap in technology capacity.","[8, 9]"
54d188e,"Indeed, despite a slowing of the trend towards greater market-income disparities, income inequality after adding benefits and taxes has increased at faster rate since the mid-90s than it had in the decade before. Benefits have a much stronger impact on inequality than social contributions or taxes, despite the bigger aggregate size of direct taxes and, hence, their bigger average impact on household incomes. In general, changes on the benefit side can therefore be expected to be a more significant driver of the extent of overall redistribution and inequality. On average across 29 OECD countries, cash support for working-age individuals and their families has grown in real terms but has accounted for a declining share of total social spending (the share fell from 27% in 1985 to 25% in 1995 and 21% in 2005).",[10]

c7bc259,"The surges in consumption in recent years, as examined in chapter IV, could easily be erased by a reversal of the business cycle, threatening access to basic consumer staples for this broad swathe of the population. The most evident of these features is that the poverty rate for children is considerably higher than for the rest of the population. Poverty rates among children aged 15 and under are between 1.1 and 2.0 times greater than for the general population, with the largest discrepancies seen in countries with lowest overall poverty rates. With a number of exceptions, in many countries poverty and age tend to be inversely correlated.",[1]

All in all, the increase in exposure to these events will result in greater direct economic losses (IPCC, 2013). Extreme waves are becoming more common and will shape the design of maritime infrastructure works in the region, since failing to consider long-term change factors would reduce the viability of such works to about 60% of their current level by 2070. The impacts and adaptation processes will undoubtedly be of significant magnitude, and will increase over the course of the century across many areas of economic activity such as the agriculture sector, the water sector, land use changes, biodiversity, tourism, infrastructure and the health of the population.","[2, 8, 9, 13, 15]"

Although these actions can have marginal mitigation effects at the global scale, they are important for ensuring environmentally sustainable development in the region. Building a culture of risk prevention and developing a large-scale climate change adaptation strategy are essential steps. Of its 550 million people, 77% live in cities of more than 2,000 inhabitants, a rate that approaches 90% in the Southern Cone and is forecast to rise across the region to 85% by 2030. Cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants alone are home to two thirds of the region's population, the highest rate in the world (ECLAC, 2012d). The system of cities in Latin America is highly varied in terms of size and conformation, but in general, the countries tend to have several megalopolises alongside strong urbanization and growing importance for medium-sized cities.","[11, 13]"

In Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia, there is no limitation for the first contract, but cumulative time limits step in when a renewal occur, or a new contract between the same employer and employee is signed. In this case, workers are hired by an agency and temporarily assigned for work into a user firm, typically to perform temporary tasks outside the “core” business of the user firm or to enable it to cope with short-term increases in workload.",[8]
1afd2ee,"Trade liberalisation (the removal of barriers to cross-border trade) has historically been negotiated at the World Trade Organization (WTO), trade agreements negotiated there translate into impacts within countries and therefore have significant implications for household wellbeing and gender equality1. There is now considerable empirical evidence that international trade agreements have a differential impact on women and men at household, firm and national levels (Randriamaro, 2006, Carr and Williams, 2010, World Bank, 2012, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 2012), creating disparities in how the opportunities and challenges of globalisation are experienced. Yet, there have been only limited attempts over the decades during which global trade negotiations have been taking place to mainstream2, or integrate, gender concerns into trade policy and negotiations. Our research confirms that the first hurdle, that of holding the position of ambassador or head of mission (HoM)3, shapes progression on to the decision-making and accountable committees and councils of the WTO.",[5]

These systems have an essential role to play in addressing persistent poverty, protecting households against income and health-related risks and tackling income inequality. It revealed that having social protection systems in place before a crisis strengthens the effectiveness of social policy responses to changing needs. The first is to ensure that social protection systems provide adequate support to those who need it in a context of limited fiscal resources and weak administration and a high rate of informal work that leaves large parts of the workforce uncovered by the main instruments of social policy.","[1, 3, 8]"

Data points for members of the EU are ordered by changes in the share of highest-paying occupations. By contrast, the 50-10 ratio has remained fairly stable at a level of about 15 per cent above its level of the early 1970s.

Important regional efforts and experiences in this regard include the creation of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, in which Mexico and seven Central American countries participate, the expansion of the Serranfa del Chiribiquete natural park in Colombia and that country's policy of conservation in the Amazon region, as well as the tropical rainforest conservation programme in Brazil, which has spurred a strong expansion in protected areas in the region and has become the driving force in reducing deforestation in the Amazon region. One example was the domestication of plants of tremendous economic value that were grown in species-rich areas inhabited by sophisticated ancient civilizations. This process was key in the development of agriculture and gave rise to hubs of origin of major crops such as maize, yucca, potatoes, peanuts, beans, squash, tomatoes, cacao, quinoa and others.","[2, 15]"
