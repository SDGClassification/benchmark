about: |
  The SDG Policy Mapping tool shows how EU policies address the Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs). The mapping helps better understand how EU policies
  relate to the SDG framework, by mapping policy documents with the SDGs and
  targets through specific keywords. It can thereby strengthen EU capacity to
  design, implement and monitor coherent and integrated policies for sustainable
  development.

  The SDG Mapper tool was developed by the JRC and DG INTPA.
