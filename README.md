# Benchmark for SDG Classification<!-- omit from toc -->

The SDG Classification Benchmark is an open and public benchmarking dataset for evaluating and comparing SDG classification models. It consists of text snippets (2 - 3 sentences), which have been carefully labeled and verified by a team of human experts.

**Note**: The benchmarking dataset currently covers SDGs 1, 3 - 7 and 10. We will be expanding the benchmarking dataset to other SDGs in the coming months.

## The dataset

You can find the benchmarking dataset here: https://github.com/SDGClassification/benchmark/blob/main/benchmark.csv

The dataset consists of four columns:

- `id`: Unique identifier for every text (MD5 hash)
- `text`: Text snippet (2 - 3 sentences)
- `sdg`: The SDG that the text is checked against
- `label`: True if `sdg` is present in `text`. False otherwise.

Below is an excerpt of the dataset.

```
     id                                               text  sdg  label

## How to use

### With Python

We have created the Python package [sdgclassification-benchmark](https://pypi.org/project/sdgclassification-benchmark/) to make it easy to benchmark SDG classification models written in Python.

First, install the package: `pip install sdgclassification-benchmark`

Then, run the benchmark on your custom `predict_sdgs` method:

```python
from sdgclassification.benchmark import Benchmark

# Take the text to classify, run it through your model and return the list of
# relevant SDGs in *numeric* format.
# IMPORTANT: ADAPT THIS METHOD ACCORDING YOUR MODEL
def predict_sdgs(text: str) -> list[int]:
    # ... your model code here ...
    return [1, 7, 17]

benchmark = Benchmark(predict_sdgs)
benchmark.run()
```

You will see the following output:

```bash

After running the benchmark, you can also access detailed results in your Python script, showing you where the model has made correct and incorrect predictions.

```python
# Convert results into a Pandas dataframe
df = benchmark.results.to_dataframe()

### With other languages

Using your preferred CSV reader/parser, you can access the benchmarking dataset from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SDGClassification/benchmark/main/benchmark.csv

For example, in R:

```r
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SDGClassification/benchmark/main/benchmark.csv")
```

You can then classify the `text` in each row of the dataset and compare your model's predictions with the true label.

You can [find short descriptions about each of the columns in the dataset here](#the-dataset).

## Background

### Purpose

There exist a number of different models and approaches for classifying texts with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Refer to [this list](https://globalgoals-directory.notion.site/PUBLIC-List-of-AI-driven-SDG-Classification-Initiatives-fe4770a173194e0b980f95b330a8a83b) for a (non-exhaustive) overview of different SDG classifiers and initiatives.

To further advance the field of SDG classification, it is important that we understand the strengths and weaknesses of the available tools.

This public and open benchmarking dataset allows us to evaluate and compare the accuracy of available SDG classifiers, so that we can better grasp their capabilities and limitations.

Our hope is that this benchmarking dataset can contribute to us building more accurate, more reliable and more trustworthy models and approaches in the future.

### Approach

This benchmarking dataset has been carefully curated by a [working group](#core-contributors) with expert knowledge in the domain of the SDGs. Unlike other datasets, this benchmarking dataset has been fully annotated and verified by humans.

To ensure a robust benchmarking dataset, the texts for each SDG were independently annotated by several human experts. For most texts, the annotations made by these experts were identical. For some texts, however, there initially were disagreements between the annotations. These disagreements were resolved through discussion between the experts until consensus was reached.

In some cases, consensus was reached by making slight modifications to a text in order to remove ambiguity.

### Coverage

The dataset currently covers SDGs 1, 3 - 7 and 10.

| SDG                                | Number of texts | Texts with SDG | Texts without SDG |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------: | -------------: | ----------------: |
| SDG 1: No poverty                  |              77 |             27 |                50 |
| SDG 3: Good health and well-being  |              76 |             28 |                48 |
| SDG 4: Quality education           |              82 |             43 |                39 |
| SDG 5: Gender equality             |              69 |             35 |                34 |
| SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation  |              85 |             48 |                37 |
| SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy |             100 |             50 |                50 |
| SDG 10: Reduced inequalities       |              61 |             32 |                29 |

Note that the number of texts across the SDGs as well as the number of texts with and without SDG are currently not balanced. The working group is focusing first on expanding the benchmark to all SDGs with at least 50 texts each &mdash; the exact number of texts for each SDG will depend on how difficult it is to reach consensus within the working group. In the long-term, the group is planning to expand the number of texts for each SDG to one hundred.

### Limitations

While we have invested a lot of time and care to ensure that this benchmarking dataset is as robust as possible, there are important limitations to be aware of when using this dataset to evaluate your model.

This benchmark serves as a starting point for evaluating the accuracy of a model. It is important to remember that models may have been developed for domain-specific use cases, languages, and/or other specializations that cannot be comprehensively evaluated with this benchmarking dataset.

#### Binary

We evaluated each text only with respect to whether it directly addresses a given SDG and its targets. This assessment was binary (`true` vs `false`), which greatly reduced the complexity.

We did not evaluate how strong the reference is, we did not evaluate whether other SDGs are present in the text and we did not evaluate what the primary SDG in each text is.

#### Non-exhaustive

We have tried to include a variety of texts in this benchmarking dataset in order to cover the breadth of each SDG. For example, for SDG 7, we have included texts related not just to renewable energy, but also texts related to energy access, affordable energy, energy efficiency, etc...

That said, due to the wide spectrum of issues covered by the SDGs, we cannot guarantee that this benchmarking dataset provides exhaustive coverage of all the relevant issues for each of the SDGs.

#### Ignores sentiment

For the sake of simplicity, we ignored valence and sentiment in the texts. A text was classified as addressing a given SDG, even if the content was discussed in a negative light. For example, "We will reduce renewable energy subsidies" would still be classified as `true` for SDG 7.

#### Non-interpretive

Texts were only assigned to a given SDG, if the text directly addressed that SDG and/or its targets. "We are subsidizing the costs of silicon" would not qualify for SDG 7, even though silicon is one of the materials for making photovoltaic cells and reduced cost of silicon might have indirect benefits for the expansion of solar energy.

We ignored indirect relevance in texts because correct assessments would require enormous thematic expertise, and even then such interpretations would often remain highly subjective and controversial.

## Model evaluation

### Disclaimer

Several models have been tested against this benchmark. The results can be used as one criterion when evaluating models. Importantly, there are a range of other important aspects to consider that are not tested by this benchmark, such as cost, speed, and coverage of SDG targets. In addition, many models have been developed and optimized for domain-specific use cases (e.g. analyzing policy documents, research articles or websites) and their performance on this benchmark may not be representative of their performance on their domain-specific use case.
